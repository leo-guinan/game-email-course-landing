    <h1>Find Your Game</h1>
    <p class="subhead">A 5-day email course to identify which creator game you're playing—and why your content isn't compounding.</p>

  <main>
    <section class="problem">
      <p>There are 6 creator games.</p>
      <p>Most creators are playing 3-4 at once without knowing it.</p>
      <p>That's why your content doesn't compound. Your audience can't pattern-match. Your leverage stays weak. Your systems break when you try to delegate.</p>
      <p>This course helps you see it.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="what-you-do">
      <h2>What you'll do:</h2>
      <p>Over 5 days, you'll run a series of prompts against your own content.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Identify your primary game</li>
        <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Audit your last 10 posts for consistency</li>
        <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Diagnose your collision pattern</li>
        <li><strong>Day 4:</strong> Draft a piece of "clean" content</li>
        <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> Understand the limits of self-diagnosis</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each email takes 10-15 minutes. You'll need access to Claude or ChatGPT.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="what-you-have">
      <h2>What you'll have at the end:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your primary game (the one you're actually playing)</li>
        <li>Your aspirational game (the one you think you're playing)</li>
        <li>Your collision pattern (which games are conflicting)</li>
        <li>Your consistency score (how often you drift)</li>
        <li>One piece of clean content (so you feel the difference)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="fit">
      <div class="fit-for">
        <h3>This is for you if:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You're posting consistently but nothing compounds</li>
          <li>You've tried different formats/topics/schedules and you're still stuck</li>
          <li>You suspect something structural is broken but can't name it</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="fit-not">
        <h3>Not for you if:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You're just starting out (you need reps first, not diagnosis)</li>
          <li>You're happy with your current trajectory</li>
          <li>You want motivation (this is structural, not inspirational)</li>
