      <p><strong>You've probably felt this:</strong></p>
      <p>The job titles don't fit. The career paths feel like prisons. The identities people adopt—"founder," "creator," "leader"—feel like performances you're supposed to commit to forever.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, you can see <em>why</em> people play the games they're playing. You understand their positions. You can model their perspectives. Sometimes you can see the whole system so clearly that you don't know where you belong in it.</p>
      <p>This isn't confusion. It's clarity that looks like confusion to everyone else.</p>
      <p><strong>The internet promised us fluid identity.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Instead we got identity capture.</strong></p>
      <p>Every platform wants you to pick a lane. Pick an audience. Pick a niche. Build a personal brand and optimize it forever.</p>
      <p>But what if you're not one thing? What if the static identity everyone's demanding is exactly what's stopping you from coordinating with the people who actually matter?</p>
      <p><strong>And what if the window to build the alternative is closing faster than you think?</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="copy-block">
      <h2>The Window Is Closing</h2>
      <p><strong>Right now, there's chaos.</strong></p>
      <p>AI is dissolving job categories. Remote work fractured "office culture." The creator economy proved you can't monetize attention without selling your soul. Web3 promised coordination without institutions and delivered speculation instead.</p>
      <p>Everyone's searching for new models. New ways to work. New ways to build. New ways to coordinate.</p>
      <p><strong>The next 12-24 months will determine what gets built.</strong></p>
      <p>The people who understand <em>why</em> the old coordination infrastructure is broken will build the new one.</p>
      <p>The people who are still trying to "find their niche" in the old system will wake up in five years wondering why nothing works anymore.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="copy-block">
      <h2>The Problem Isn't You</h2>
      <p><strong>Jobs:</strong> Pretend roles are permanent identities. Switching feels like failure.</p>
      <p><strong>Freelancing:</strong> Every engagement has different rules. Trust is impossible to build.</p>
      <p><strong>Social Media:</strong> You are your metrics. There's no exit that isn't failure.</p>
      <p><strong>Networks:</strong> Require persistent identity. If you change, you're flaky.</p>
      <p>None of these work for people who can see clearly enough to know that identity should be temporary, contextual, and role-based—not fixed, permanent, and all-consuming.</p>
      <p>You're not broken. <strong>The coordination infrastructure is.</strong></p>
      <p>And the people building the replacement are moving <em>fast</em>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="copy-block">
      <h2>What If Games Had Roles Instead of Identities?</h2>
      <p>Imagine:</p>
      <p>You join a game. The game has defined roles. You take a role. You play it well for a season. The season ends. You exit cleanly. Your performance is recorded. You move to the next game.</p>
      <p><strong>No permanent identity required.</strong></p>
      <p>Just demonstrated capability in specific contexts.</p>
      <p>Your reputation becomes: "They play the strategist role well in network games" or "They're excellent at the guide role in transformation games."</p>
      <p>Not: "This is who they ARE."</p>
      <p><strong>This is how coordination worked before the internet tried to freeze everyone in place.</strong></p>
      <p>It's how sports work. How theater works. How healthy projects work.</p>
      <p>The game provides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Roles</strong> (clear expectations for behavior)</li>
        <li><strong>Rules</strong> (shared understanding of how to play)</li>
        <li><strong>Seasons</strong> (bounded time commitment)</li>
        <li><strong>Outcomes</strong> (observable results, not claimed expertise)</li>
        <li><strong>Clean exits</strong> (no shame in leaving when the season ends)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <hr>

    <section class="copy-block">
      <h2>You're Not Lost. You're Between Games.</h2>
      <p>The feeling you have—that you don't fit anywhere—isn't because you're confused about who you are.</p>
      <p>It's because <strong>you need infrastructure that doesn't exist yet.</strong></p>
      <p>Infrastructure for people who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can see multiple valid perspectives simultaneously</li>
        <li>Understand systems well enough to know fixed positions are traps</li>
        <li>Need to move between contexts without accumulating identity debt</li>
        <li>Want to coordinate deeply without committing permanently</li>
        <li>Have skills that don't fit neat categories</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You're waiting for <strong>Internet 2.0</strong>—where ego doesn't dominate and coordination does.</p>
      <p>Where identity is what you do in a specific game, not what you claim to be forever.</p>
      <p>Where trust builds through observable performance, not through frozen personal brands.</p>
      <p>Where flickering between games is normal, expected, healthy.</p>

      <h2>The Six Games Framework</h2>
      <p>There are only six games that matter for transformation:</p>
      <ul class="six-games">
        <li><strong>G1 - Identity/Canon:</strong> Curating who matters and what counts</li>
        <li><strong>G2 - Idea Mining:</strong> Extracting applicable insights from the territory</li>
        <li><strong>G3 - Model Building:</strong> Understanding how things actually work</li>
        <li><strong>G4 - Performance/Coaching:</strong> Improving measurable capabilities</li>
        <li><strong>G5 - Meaning/Sensemaking:</strong> Creating coherence from change</li>
        <li><strong>G6 - Network/Coordination:</strong> Connecting the right people</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most people play all six badly because they're forced to do it from a single frozen identity.</p>
      <p>You could play each one well—<strong>if you could take the right role in the right game at the right time.</strong></p>

      <h2>This 5-Day Course Will Show You How</h2>
      <p><strong>Five days. One framework. Real work.</strong></p>
      <p>This isn't "consume content and feel good." This is "understand the game and prove you can play."</p>
      <p>Each day includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core concept</strong> (10-15 min read)</li>
        <li><strong>Deep dive</strong> (30-45 min extended reading)</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise</strong> (30-60 min applied work)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Complete all five exercises and submit them → Get 50% off the 4-week intensive workshop ($500 value)</strong></p>
      <p>Why proof-of-work? Because <strong>this is how the game is structured for a reason.</strong></p>
      <p>The people who will build Internet 2.0 aren't passive consumers. They're people who can see a structure, understand it, and demonstrate capability within it.</p>
      <p>If you can't complete five exercises in five days, you're not ready to build coordination infrastructure for others.</p>

    <section class="faq">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Q: Is this just another personality framework?</strong></dt>
        <dd>No. The Six Games aren't personality types. They're role categories in different coordination contexts. You'll learn to play multiple games, not get categorized into one.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Q: Why only 5 days?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Because the people who need this don't have time to waste. Either you can commit to understanding the framework in five days or you can't. If you can't, this isn't for you yet.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Q: What if I can't complete all the exercises?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Then you don't get the workshop discount. Simple. This is proof-of-work by design. The people building coordination infrastructure don't need hand-holding.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Q: How much time will this actually take?</strong></dt>
        <dd>1-2 hours per day for five days. If you can't carve out 5-10 hours in a week for something this important, you're not serious about building what comes next.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Q: What's the workshop?</strong></dt>
        <dd>4 weeks, live cohort. You'll design actual games, build role-based systems, and run your first season with real stakes. Not theory—building.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Q: Is the email course free?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Yes. The framework needs to spread. The workshop has a cost because real coordination requires real commitment.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Q: What if I'm not ready to build "Internet 2.0"?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Then don't take the course. This is for people who are ready to move <em>now</em>, not people who want to "think about it."</dd>
